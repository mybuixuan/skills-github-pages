# Reformer Pilates: Strength with Precision

Reformer Pilates takes everything powerful about traditional Pilates and adds a dynamic twist — resistance.

Using a spring-based machine called the *reformer*, this style of Pilates challenges your muscles through controlled, flowing movements. The adjustable springs create tension that builds strength, improves stability, and enhances flexibility all at once.

## Why Try Reformer?

- Deep core activation  
- Low-impact, joint-friendly training  
- Full-body strength and toning  
- Improved posture and alignment  
- Increased balance and coordination  

The moving carriage forces your body to stay stable while in motion — meaning your core is always working. It’s challenging, focused, and surprisingly energizing.

Reformer Pilates isn’t about speed. It’s about control, precision, and feeling every single movement.
